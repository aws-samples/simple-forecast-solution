# Manual Deployment

AFA can be manually installed from the command-line in this directory (`cdk/`).

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
- `node`, `npm`
- The command-line terminal has assumed an IAM role with the permissions
  described in the `cdk/bootstrap.py` CDK script.

```bash
# install `cdk`
npm i -g aws-cdk@2.13.0 # (or similar version ~2.x.x)

# deploy AFA
make deploy EMAIL=<your email address> INSTANCE_TYPE=<ml.* ec2 instance type>
```
